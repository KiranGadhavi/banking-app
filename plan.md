1. Banking-app Plan, Features and Architecture ✅

Before jumping into coding, it's crucial to have a clear roadmap of the app's functionality and architecture.

    I'm Defining the Core Features:
        Deposit money
        Withdraw money
        Transfer money (IBAN only)
        View account statements
        Sorting and filtering transactions (optional bonuses)
        Pagination (optional bonus)

    I would like to Break Down the App Structure: Identify the main pages and components:
        Home page or dashboard
        Account overview (shows balance and recent transactions)
        Transaction forms (deposit, withdraw, transfer)
        Transaction history (sortable and filterable)

I will follow these steps as a guide for what components I'll need to build and how they will interact.

2. Set Up a Component Library (Optional) ✅

While I planned to use Tailwind CSS, I want some reusable components to speed up my development process:

    Reusable UI Components: Create basic components like buttons, forms, input fields, and transaction cards. This will keep the codebase clean and consistent.
    Atomic Design Approach: Consider breaking down the UI into atoms (e.g., buttons), molecules (e.g., input forms), and organisms (e.g., transaction list components).
    Example:
    Button Component:
    Form Input Component:
    Transaction Card Component:
    This will help the maintain a consistent design across the app.

Lets start with a few components:

    Button Component: For consistent styles.
    Form Input Component: For handling user inputs like amounts, IBANs, etc.
    Transaction Card Component: To display transaction details such as date, amount, and balance.

3. Now, I would like to Set Up State Management ✅

Since a banking app involves complex interactions between different parts of the UI, managing the app state will be crucial.

    React Context API: For lightweight global state management to handle user session data, account information, or transaction history.
    Redux (optional): If app requires more sophisticated state management, consider adding libraries like Redux to manage global states like user sessions, balances, and transaction details.

Example:

    Use Context or a custom hook (useBankAccount) to manage account balances and update transactions globally.
    Use Redux to manage user sessions, balances, and transaction details.

    4. Simulate API with Mock Data ✅

Since I won’t be interacting with an actual backend at the moment, I'll need to simulate API behavior:

    Mock Data: Store the account and transaction data locally or in the browser (using localStorage or IndexedDB).
    API Simulation: Create utility functions or services that simulate API calls to fetch data, deposit money, withdraw, and transfer.
    Example:
    We can use fetch or axios to simulate API calls to fetch data, deposit money, withdraw, and transfer.
    5. Create Routing and Page Structure

I'm using Next.js’s powerful routing system to set up pages for each core feature:

    App Routes:
        /dashboard: Displays account balance and recent transactions.
        /deposit: Form for depositing money.
        /withdraw: Form for withdrawing money.
        /transfer: Form for transferring money to IBAN accounts.
        /statement: Displays transaction history and supports filtering, sorting, and pagination.

I will start with simple pages for each feature, and then progressively enhance them by adding more complex functionality (e.g., pagination, sorting).

6. Set Up Styling
   I'm using Tailwind CSS to style this banking app.
   Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly build custom designs without leaving your HTML.

7. Lets Implement Key Features One by One

Now, it’s time to start building the app step by step. Begin with the core functionality and implement it in small, manageable pieces.

    Deposit Feature: Create a page that allows users to deposit money. Update the account balance and store the transaction locally.
    Withdraw Feature: Add similar functionality for withdrawing money.
    Transfer Feature: Implement validation for IBAN format and prevent transfers to non-IBAN accounts.
    Account Statement: Display a sorted transaction history with pagination if necessary.

9. Unit Testing and CI/CD Setup

   Unit Testing: I will use tools like Jest or React Testing Library to test my most critical components and logic. Start by testing the most important parts like transactions and balance updates.
   CI/CD Pipeline: I would Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code changes do not break any functionality. Tools like GitHub Actions can automate testing and deployment processes.

10. Version Control and Collaboration
    As I'm working on this project, I'll use Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration.
    Commit Changes: Commit your code changes regularly to track progress and ensure you can revert to previous versions if needed.

Next Steps Summary:

    Plan features and structure.
    Create reusable components for UI consistency.
    Set up state management (Context API or Zustand).
    Simulate API interactions with mock data.
    Create pages and routing for core features.
    Leverage TypeScript types for type safety.
    Tailwind CSS setup for responsiveness.
    Build core functionalities (deposit, withdraw, transfer).
    Unit testing and CI/CD setup.
    Collaborate and document via GitHub.

By following these steps, I'll have a well-structured and functional banking app.
